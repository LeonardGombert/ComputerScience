Linked List
- The problem : group pieces of data by creating a linear list, with each 
element referencing the next and previous data's memory location.

- Node struct containing the data of type T, previous and next pointers, index of the Node
- A Node StartPointer and TailPointer to keep track of first and last elements of the list
- A ListCount int, to keep track of list size
- Subscript operator overload (?) -> be to able to retrieve an element of your list

- Template Node struct :
	T dataValue
	Next/Previous Node struct pointer (unique pointer?)
	const int Index

LinkedList class that contains : 
	- int listSize
 	- add(&&) -> creates new Node and moves the value that was passed as a parameter
	- remove(i) -> removes node at index of i
	- operator const [] (i) -> will check to see if starting at beginning or end, and go previous x i or next x i
	- count() -> returns the listSize
	- T last() -> returns the value of last node
	- T first() -> returns the value of first node
